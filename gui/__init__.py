"""MDMA Modular GUI Package.

This package implements the modular sub-window architecture described
in docs/specs/GUI_WINDOW_ARCHITECTURE_SPEC.md.  It replaces the
monolithic mdma_gui.py with a set of focused, workflow-sorted
sub-windows that communicate through the Bridge layer and Object
Registry.

Entry point: gui.shell.MDMAShell (wx.Frame)

BUILD ID: gui_v1.0_phase1
